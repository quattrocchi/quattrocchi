- 👋 Hi, I’m @quattrocchi 
- 👀 I’m making jewellery and, occasionally, eyeglasses in jewellery metals
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FreeCad to help with the eyeglasses. At the moment I use 1mm graph paper and an application called wProCAD+, which I used when I was using RiscOS.
- 💞️ I’m new to github, I don't even recall how I got onto it.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
